# CancerTypePrediction
This project aims to predict renal vs adrenal cancer from transcriptome profiles of primary pediatric tumors using Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Feedforward Neural Net respectively.

*Please see FinalReport.pdf for details on the background, methods, and results.*
### Results
All of our models have high precision and high recall, and all have achieved F1 scores greater than 0.96.

Through clustering and visualizing the data using PCR and tSNE, we here report that there exists a subphenotype of pediatric kidney cancer based on transcriptome data.
